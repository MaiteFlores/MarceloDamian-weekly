  I hope to enhance my skills and grow from this class. I hope to become a better programmer and improve my efficiency in writing code. I look forward to sharing ideas and developing them further. I am also eager to learn new techniques in problem solving and having fun in the process. I believe that my participation in  this open source software development course will provide me with in-demand skills. I also believe that learning about the logistics and legality of coding projects is an absolute must. I hope that this course will shed light on licensing and other non-programming aspects of software engineering.
