**About me**

  *I hope to enhance my skills and definitely grow out of this class. I hope to become a better programmer and learn how to
better improve and be more efficent in writing code. I am looking forward in sharing ideas and developing them further.
I am also really looking forward to having fun in learning new techniques in problem solving. I also believe that in taking 
this course , open source software development, that I will enhance and better the skills neccesary in todays' time. I believe 
that learning about the logistics and legality of coding projects is an absolute must for many company settings. I believe 
that this course will teach me a lot about the licensing and conditions aspects that take place outside of the software 
engineering setting, as well.*
