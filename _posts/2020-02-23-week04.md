# Projects I have looked at:

[OpenBionics] (https://github.com/OpenBionics)

[Codezilla](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla)

[Hydrogen](https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen) 

[Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)


# Projects I have eliminated and why

  ### Hydrogen
  I have chosen to eliminate Hydrogen because of its complexity with graphics and other designs that I personally have very limited knowledge of. 
  
  ### OpenBionics
  I was really hoping to do this one. I'm in love with the mission statement and overall purpose. However, its lack of activity on github made it a poor choice. There are 4 issues, over the span of 4 years, one of which has been resolved in 2016. Its lack of activity, on the sight, has made me turn to other projects.
