## Initial Thoughts on Open Source is Not About You
  Some main points that i thought were really captivating about her perspective on open software many detailed independcy and the openness of working on an open source software project. Not having strings attatched is the center point throughout the article. I really like how he expresses this passive/aggressive tone to detail the certain gaps and misinterpertations of what open source software is. He details it in such a way where it is very raw and logical. He expresses it as, "Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism ". There is no obligation on any contributor whatsoever nor responsibilities. What I also liked about this reading was his expression on this false communal infrastucture obligation that has been built. The very mechanisms revoving around open software he expresses will in no doubt free the very seeded misconceptions and turn any pre-existing notions.

## Issues in Depth:
  
 **A few of these issues are:**

Issues| Analysis | Design/Ideas? | Pathway(s)
|---|----|----|:---|

|[Issue #1: Unsuscribe Link not working](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38322)| Code for redirection might be at fault, some unmet edge cases, or something wrong with importing. | Testing whether it is an import database problem or a redirection problem.| freeCodeCamp/client/src/pages/unsubscribed.js or freeCodeCamp/client/src/client-only-routes/ShowUnsubscribed.js
|[Issue #2: Need to allow to use helper functions for the recursive challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37868) | A bug that doesn't allow helper functions to be used for recursive challenges|Some set of instructions that detect whether or not the user is using a helper function or not. A different sequence of instructions depending on what the user uses. | freeCodeCamp/curriculum/challenges/english/02-javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown.english.md
|[Issue #3: Testing non-english challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/34641) | There seems to be some ambiguity on the access of languages. In some places languages are specified, while in others they arent.|Format everything universally there should be a constant/similar format for language declaration throughout.|
|[Issue #4: Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525) | | |
|[Issue #5: Hash Table challenge test case](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38049) | | |
