title: Week 8

## Week recap: 
  The first time I heard about the coronavirus was from my mother, a couple of months back. I remember my mom telling me that she saw online about a bunch of cases and people being effected around the world. I remembered how afraid she was about a possible outbreak in NYC. I assured her that everything was going to be alright and that it was contained. My parents and my sister, had been talking about a vacation trip prior to the corona outbreak and had even booked their flights at the beginning of March and had planned to come back in less than 2 weeks. The deal was that I was going to be left home alone for less than a week and my sister was going to come back. There was a misunderstanding with the airline she was boarding and she ended up rescheduling her flight to leave with my family. The corona virus was now spreading around NYC and they had now just moved to distance learning. However, Nyc wasn't the only victim advancing. Ecuador, the place they flew to, had also experienced wide outbreaks. Instead of coming back to NYC in a few days they are set to come back in 2 months. All the flights were cancelled, and their wasn't anyone that was coming in or out of Ecuador. They were stuck there. No one could come back. Not my mom, dad, nor sister. It is just my dog and I for the next 2 months. Holding the responsibility of being the landlord is something new and unplanned for. Everything was changing. I am ready for any adversity that is to come with all the changes. I trust and know that I will come out of this a better person than I did at the beginning of this pandemic. "Blessings don't come to you. Blessings flow through you."- Inky Johnson. I think in 4 weeks from now things will get worser, but I am optimistic that in 8 weeks things will get better.  

## Blog Recap:

I analyzed some of the code that was written, as well as familiarized myself with Javascript. I used some of freeCodecamp's tutorial, and asked for some advice from a couple of friends who know Javascript. I can't safely say that I know it. I get some of the intution behind it, but I am still a long way from developing my own code or implementing on freeCodeCamp. However, practice is key and I am pretty optimistic on what lies ahead. A fear of mine is that I might be relating it to much to C++, and that could be what is confusing me. I am really comfortable with C++, in an intutive sense, but really afraid of what lies ahead in Javascript. I already notice a few syntax differences when comparing the two. For example the "==" sign in C++ is "===" in Javascript. Understanding Javascript, in depth, will definltey pose a challenge, but I am willing to put in the work to learn it. Who knows? I might even love it, as much as I love C++. My next few steps are to document all of the code that I have linked below. This documentation will help develop a fundamental understanding of Javascript and freeCodeCamp. Once this is done, I can try to diagnose the issue and plan accordingly.  

## Issues in Depth (updated as of March 22, 2020):
  
 **A few of these issues are:**

Issues| Analysis | Design/Ideas? |Pathway(s)/Scripts 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|[Issue #1: Unsuscribe Link not working](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38322)|Code for redirection might be at fault, some unmet edge cases, or something wrong with importing. | Testing whether it is an import database problem or a redirection problem.| [unsubscribed.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5IZmCnEVrGd2PX6qWgL2Ojxrm6OVnexnEa3FMyHR7o/edit?usp=sharing) [ShowUnsubscribed.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1MLzVgAKYM4JwdT5lDOXcCbL_HeJlJelgd77QocM6s/edit?usp=sharing)
|[Issue #2: Need to allow to use helper functions for the recursive challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37868) | A bug that doesn't allow helper functions to be used for recursive challenges|Some set of instructions that detect whether or not the user is using a helper function or not. A different sequence of instructions depending on what the user uses. |[use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown.english.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14O3R5eJ9QVXHUSJUUN9pu1ZiiaqGdCN_W_fjyG81lwE/edit?usp=sharing)
|[Issue #3: Testing non-english challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/34641) | There seems to be some ambiguity on the access of languages. In some places languages are specified, while in others they arent.|Format everything universally there should be a constant/similar format for language declaration throughout.|[test-challenges.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W4agw8oMxi2prBTu3jzAvG9_177N5Ww_TbobHKeS0w8/edit?usp=sharing)
|[Issue #4: Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525) | Conditions might not be sufficent to meet case-insensitive standards| Implement a case where a user could have lowercase or uppercase usernames. The computer has to essentially treat lowercase and uppercase the same way. They should be indistinguishable to the computer.|[Username.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cATdhx17DMxEOSBq_rRYzIerwy97G05tFedbsS9g_l8/edit?usp=sharing)
|[Issue #5: Hash Table challenge test case](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38049)|A bug that allows users to successfully complete the challenge without implementing the remove method.| There might be a flaw in how it is recieving the remove method or a possible edge case.|[create-a-hash-table.english.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0wbVJLQBbpWOfZPV8m5h0c1ZZ1O-heJ0dW2kW0LvEE/edit?usp=sharing)
