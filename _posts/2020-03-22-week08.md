title: Week 8
---

## Week recap: 
  Uff this week has been something. I am not sure where to even start. I first heard about the coronavirus from my mother. It was a couple of weeks ago prior to the outbreak in NYC. I remember my mom telling me that she wfirst saw it online, and that she was afraid that it was going to come to nyc. i assured her there that it wasnt going to come to nyc. My mom,dad, and sister had alredy bought a plane ticket to ecuador at the end of february. The deal was that I was going to be left home alone for 3-4 days, and my sister was going to come back the 3rd day and my mom and dad the following few days. I kept hearing more and more oubreaks in schools, from my friends and collegues and then they move on to distant learning. My family was going to come back the following few days, but all planes were detained and nothing was coming in or going out of ecuador. They were stuck there. This happened around the same time that we switched to remote learning. No one could come back, not my mom dad nor sister for the next 2 months until May. What was supposed to be 3 days turned into 2 months, and everything was now changing. It was just me and my dog for the next 2 months.I didnt expect to hold the responsibily of being a landlord for the next few months until my family came back. I am ready for whatever adversity is to come because I trust and know that I will come out of this a better person. I think in 4 weeks from now things will get worser, but I am positive that in 8 weeks things will get better. If it's not in 8 weeks then its later, but I do have believe things will get better.

|[Issue #2: Need to allow to use helper functions for the recursive challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37868) | A bug that doesn't allow helper functions to be used for recursive challenges|Some set of instructions that detect whether or not the user is using a helper function or not.
