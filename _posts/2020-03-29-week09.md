## Week recap: 

Write about what you found, or what you discovered and what was hard while investigating Wikipedia's pages.


Read Why to Report Bugs and comment about it.



Write about the visit by Kevin Fleming. What did you learn? What was unexpected?



 ## Blog Recap :
 
 I was kind of bummed out when I found out that two of the issues that I have been working on had closed in that past week. 
 I documented the code for the first issue [](), and had attempted to develop a full understanding on its functions and how it worked. Only to find out that it has been closed. I quickly learned now that the issues on this github reposotry are extremely competitive and if I want to be able to solve an issue, I am going to need to look at the issues and claim then right away by commenting on them. I will also have to start documenting javascript faster, which poses a challenge since I am not familiar at all with node.js,react.js,and redux. It is going to be very hard docuementing and especially debugging some of the code, because of my lack of familiarity. I only hope that it all pays off with a successful merge, I know that feeling will make all the hours put in and failed pull requests worth it. I also documented code for another issue I found! []() I created an issue as a work-around since this issue[]() was locked to begin with. I then submitted a pull request as well []() for the same issue, it is awaiting approval from one more reviewer ! I sincerely, hope it is approve. But I understand that failures are to follow.

|[Issue #1: Can't login for the last few days ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37457)|Code for redirection might be at fault, some unmet edge cases, or something wrong with importing. | Testing whether it is an import  problem or a redirection problem.| [login.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5IZmCnEVrGd2PX6qWgL2Ojxrm6OVnexnEa3FMyHR7o/edit?usp=sharing)|

|[Issue #2: Need to allow to use helper functions for the recursive challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37868) | A bug that doesn't allow helper functions to be used for recursive challenges|Some set of instructions that detect whether or not the user is using a helper function or not. A different sequence of instructions depending on what the user uses. |[use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown.english.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14O3R5eJ9QVXHUSJUUN9pu1ZiiaqGdCN_W_fjyG81lwE/edit?usp=sharing)|


|[Issue #3: Testing non-english challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/34641) | There seems to be some ambiguity on the access of languages. In some places languages are specified, while in others they arent.|Format everything universally there should be a constant/similar format for language declaration throughout.|[test-challenges.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W4agw8oMxi2prBTu3jzAvG9_177N5Ww_TbobHKeS0w8/edit?usp=sharing) |


|[Issue #4: Allow username display to be case-insensitive](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/35525) | Conditions might not be sufficent to meet case-insensitive standards| Implement a case where a user could have lowercase or uppercase usernames. The computer has to essentially treat lowercase and uppercase the same way. They should be indistinguishable to the computer.|[Username.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cATdhx17DMxEOSBq_rRYzIerwy97G05tFedbsS9g_l8/edit?usp=sharing) |
