## Visit by Gil Yehuda

  Before the interview, I was under the impression that Gil was always an advocate for open source software development. It was alarming to find out that this wasn't always the case. This fact was especially alarming since he had seen, and worked, for both sides of the spectrum. Thus he has already weighed out the pros and cons of both sides.He could have continued to work on proprietary software, but the fact that he advocates for open source software demonstrates the flaws in proprietary software. The isolation of different factions, in proprietary software, such as documentors, coders, debuggers, security, and users are its disadvantage. This isolation essentially brings forth this lack of communication between one another.On the other hand in open source software, this communication is greatly eased by collaborators or users from different backgrounds. I wouldn't go as far as to say that there isn't any rigid structure,in open source software development, as there are moderators or even collaborators that help filter flaws and fix bugs in open source software projects.This contribution to open source software, can not only help others but it can help build your digital footprint. Gil had also pointed out that working on an open source software project can really help showcase your abilities to prospective employers.  

**Other comments:**

  On a different but somewhat related note, I was wondering what would happen if we were to take the same approach, from a strict/rigid structure to a more open and collaborative one, to constructing mathematical proofs. I have actually been wondering about this for some time. Personally I think that, we as a society, could get farther along in mathematics if we were to open source mathematical proofs. I definitely think if the same filtering, moderating, and contributing processes, of an open source project, occured for mathematical proofs. That it would greatly advance much of the work. I can't help but think about Srinivasa Ramanujan, a famous indian mathematician, who made enormous strives in mathematics without having the formal structural concept of mathematical proofs. It was simply his creativity and his collaboaration with Professor G.H.Hardy that allowed him to reach levels of success. 

## Recap Folding@Home's Covid19 Activity 

  I am extremely impressed with everything that is being done at Folding@home, from the mission statement down to their plan of attack. They are open sourcing a potential solution to Covid19. I have never personally seen an actual simulation of a protein, much less generated by computational power. I wonder if a quantum computer would be extremely useful in this case. It is unbelieveable to think about how sophisticated technology has gotten. I can't help but think about this ongoing race between technology and viruses. I believe it closely resembles the "red queens race". A race where it looks as if they are moving really fast, but in actuality they are just running in place. Technology and the evolution of virsuses, in many ways, complement one another. The better medicine or technology we have, the better the virsuses adapt and evolve. They are both just an everlasting race that doesn't terminate. I love how Folding@Home is reaching out to other partners and is making the data accessible to everyone. Collaboration and communication are key to resolving such a huge issue as this one. I only wish that more people knew about what Folding@Home is doing or they had a link to their git repository on their website. If a lot of people contribute and it is well manage, I believe its only time before they find a viable solution.  

## Blog Recap

  These past two weeks have been a rollercoaster of emotions.My first pull request got closed unfortunately. The issue was particulary limited to collaborators because it was only relative to the person who posted the issue as he had a special case. This situation was very unfortunate as I had spent hours trying to document and debug the issue. However, my sadness was short lived as I manage to have a successful merge! After failing on my first issue I moved on to the next one. While trying to figure out a game plan for [Issue #1](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/34641), I had decided to go looking for areas of improvement on their README.md. After creating an extensive list at all of the areas for improvement, I began to commit. I first synced up all the new updates and changes to the master branch and made sure to be up to date. I then created a different branch, in my terminal, where I could work in. I made the edits and targeted their master branch. I went to sleep, shortly after, not expecting them to successfully merge my edits since they are really specific when it comes to merging pull requests and would likely not merge it. I woke up to an email, the next morning, suggesting an edit to my pull request for it to be successfully merged. I quickly grabbed my laptop made the edits to my existing pull request and quickly issued another pull request on their[README.md](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38561)! It was a very exciting morning for me, as I prior to that they had denyed one of my pull requests. I informed my group and, in the following days, was happy to hear that they had gone ahead and made some pull requests of their own! Denice has this well organzied and printed out in her [blog!](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/deniceysv-weekly/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2020-04-19-week10.md) The following days has led me optimistic of what follows for this project and for my group.
