## Vicky Brasseur Recap:

  I really admired the way Vicky Brasseur carried herself out.It was very raw and straight forward. She expressed things how they actually were, without sugar coating anything, based on her personal experience. An issue, that I personally found interesting that she brought up was inclusivity in Open Source Software. She expresses that free and open source software hasn't yet won the hearts of everyone. FOSS hasn't essentially won, until everyone contributes in some manner. Incluisivity is key towards bringing people from different backgrounds, not only in tech to contribute and build something that can help themselves and others. In order to have people from different backgrounds contribute, she explains that free and open source software has to be welcoming. This appreciation can be done by having a strong community and culture within themselves. Personally, I couldn't agree more. I believe that everyone should be involved, in some way or the other in open source software development, especially if the contributor benefits from the functionality. 

## Code.gov Initial Thoughts:

  Some of the tasks that primarly caught my eye deal are [add broken links](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api/issues/207), [add spacing](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll/issues/127), and [Have a user-friendly project inventory](https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil/issues/241). I am definitely going to attempt to submit a pull request for one of them and hopefully get a successful merge! The one that most catches my eyes is the [spacing issue](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll/issues/127)!! It's been about 5 years since I have last created a script in css and it will definitely be a nice refresher. I am actually really surprised that the government has come forth to engage in open source software. I would't have initially thought the government would engage, in open source projects.
I have always pictured the government as a very secretive and excluded faction. I am actually really happy that they are engaging in open source software and trying to reach out to the public through open source software. However I am a bit reluctant, I wonder what they might be using this software for and if they are any limitations when using it.

## 2019 Novel Coronavirus by Johns Hopkins 

This honestly does look like a project I would contribute to. I like the functionality and the overall mission it is striving for. The more data that is gathered, the better the precision of a prediction or some correlation. This correlation could be really useful moving forward to take certian actions or precautions.  It could also be used to alert people by determining a growth factor in a certain population. I would contribute to the project as its functionality and overall mission intrigues me. One of the downsides I see in this open source software project is that it needs to be constantly mantained. I am a bit reluctant because there are a lot of issues and pull requests that have gone unanswered recently. This absense leads me to believe that it isn't nurtured and cared for, as a lot of issues and pull requests often go unanswered.

## Blog Recap:

This week has been one of the mosts toughest and productive so far. I am continuing to learn a bit more of javascript and I am definitely getting more familiar with it. Montioring freeCodeCamp's github page has become so common that it is one of the first things I do when I wake up. I have also spent a couple of hours looking at each individual file from each individual directory trying to find any inconsistency or area for clarification while trying to understand some of its functionality. I wrote all ambiguities as well as their pathname, on my notebook, and proceeded. Now it gets interesting. I was preparing to make a pull request, as i've normally done, and came across an error on my terminal that didnt allow me to to properly fetch all of the new changes that they had recently implemented. I was unaware and utterly confused as I personally haven't experienced this problem firsthand. I had my heart and mind set to find a workaround. Prior to this issue I noticed that freeCodeCamp had undergone massive modifications. They had developed a new and improved [contributions page](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/) as well as a new testing feature. Recently I had been monitoring this [change](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37053) as most of the pull requests have been frozen. They had made new testing "e2e testing" , or exchange to exchange testing I believe, using cypress. I installed [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), in the freeCodeCamp directory, figuring that might have actually been the issue that was conflicting with fetching. It did essentially help, but I was still unable to fetch from upstream. After some reasearch I came across a [github page](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) that pulled and successfully fetched all of the changes. I was pretty alarmed to see all of the new commits. I was all set!! The new installation of cypress and the new changes pulled from upstream then allowed me to successfully make a pull request! I see this new integration of cypress and modifications as an absoulte oppurtunity. There new integration leaves a room for improvement to catch everything else up to date. I found a couple of gaps they hadn't fully glossed over a couple of days ago in their tools directory. Their tools directory is always being used by developers rather than participants. I noticed that one of their links had changed due to the new modifications. One of their pages had a bunch of flaws. One of which was a link that redirected to a faulty website. I submitted a pull request after installing cypress.io and using github's method to fetch from upstream. After having a conversation with one of the moderators we decided the best way to go about this was to redirect it to a link which was the contributors chat and add a bit of text that was otherwise ambiguous.The labels for this [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38643) were "scope:docs" and "scope:tools/scripts". The next morning I woke up to an email it was succesfully merged!!! Along with another [pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38642) that fixed errors in several javascript files!! It's a beautiful way to wake up! I also have been looking at issues and seeing what I could possibly contribute. Here is a slight fix I made from one of the [moderator's issues.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38664) All in all I think it has been a very successful and rewarding week! On to the next.
